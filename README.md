# maxiconda

Cross platform conda installer purely based on [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) with [Python](https://www.python.org/) ([CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for users.

# raison d'√™tre

The 'raison d'√™tre' of this installer is that the [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) installer **does not support** [aarch64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64) processors, neighter does the [miniconda]() installer out of the box as both are based on the [anaconda channel](). There is the [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) installer though, however this one (as miniconda) installs a (very) basic `base` environment, and leaves it up to the user to do some more command line magic to get things going.

`miniconda` and `miniforge` where designed with CI in mind, `Anaconda` was designed with the **user** in mind, if we put this in a table, it becomes clear where `maxiconda` fits in :

 ![conda table](https://github.com/Semi-ATE/maxiconda/blob/main/conda_table.png)

maxiconda is thus the equivalent of `anaconda` when we want to use `conda-forge` as a base channel.

maxiconda is also installing things a bit different then anaconda in that it :

  1. Installs a small `base` environment (as miniconda and miniforge do), but as conda-forge is so big also [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) is already added to the `base` environment, [git](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/git) is also always needed and ...  [ofcourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul79ihg41Rs) [pip](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pip) is removed! Note that all sub-sequent conda environments enherit form `base`, so this is to be a  lean-mean-fighting-machine environment!
  2. Installs a `_spyder_` (application) environment where [spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) and **all** it's dependencies (required, optional and extra) live.
  3. Installs a `maxiconda` (development) environment much like the one anaconda inc. installs in the `base` environment üòí when using their installer(s), modified a bit, as it no longer holds spyder and it's dependencies, but **ONLY** the [spyder-kernels](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-kernels) and [spyder-remote-server](https://github.com/Semi-ATE/spyder-remote) packages.

It is also organized such that, when starting a terminal, the `maxiconda` environment is activated (to prevent accidental screwing up the `base` environment üòè)
