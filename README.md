## raison d'√™tre

The 'raison d'√™tre' of this installer is that the [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) installer **does not support** [arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) processors, neighter does the [miniconda]() installer out of the box as both are based on the [anaconda channel](). There is the [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) installer though, however this one (as miniconda) installs a (very) basic `base` environment, and leaves it up to the user to do some more command line magic to get things going.

`miniconda` and `miniforge` where designed with [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) in mind, (hence the `mini` prefix) whereas `anaconda` was designed with the **user** in mind, if we put this in a table, it becomes clear where `maxiconda` fits in :

 ![installer table](https://github.com/Semi-ATE/maxiconda/blob/main/doc/installer_table.png)

`maxiconda` is thus the equivalent of `anaconda` when we want to use `conda-forge` as a base channel.

`maxiconda` is also installing things a bit different then `anaconda` in that it :

  1. Installs a small `base` environment (as miniconda and miniforge do), but as the  `conda-forge` channel is [much bigger](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/) than the `anaconda` channel, [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) is added, [git](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/git) is always needed and [ofcourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul79ihg41Rs) [pip](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pip) is removed!
  2. Installs a `_spyder_` (application) environment where [spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) and **all** it's dependencies (required, optional and extra) live.
  3. Installs a `maxiconda` (development) environment much like the one that `anaconda` installs in the `base` environment üòí modified a bit, as it no longer holds spyder and it's dependencies, but **ONLY** the [spyder-kernels](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-kernels) and [spyder-remote-server](https://github.com/Semi-ATE/spyder-remote) packages. Furthermore a series of extra packages are added, [see here](https://github.com/Semi-ATE/maxiconda-meta/blob/main/metapackages.xlsx) for the full- and current package list. 

It is also organized such that, when starting a terminal, the `maxiconda` environment is activated (to prevent accidental screwing up the `base` environment üòè)

### ‚ÅΩ¬π‚Åæ Work In Progress

The `conda-forge` [channel](https://anaconda.org/search?q=pyqt) currently only holds a (very old) `pyqt=5.9.2` and an (old & semi-broken) `pyqt=5.12.3`, anyway, both of them only support `x86_64` :sob:

On January 4·µó ∞ 2021 [Riverbank Computing Ltd.](https://riverbankcomputing.com/) moved on to the 6-series of Qt and the last release in the 5-series to date is [5.15.3](https://riverbankcomputing.com/news/PyQt_v5.15.3_Released).

An effort to bring `pyqt=5.15.3` to `conda-forge` is [underway](https://github.com/conda-forge/qt-feedstock) at the same time support for `aarch64` (and thus I recon also M1) [will be added](https://github.com/conda-forge/pyqt-feedstock/pull/99). The ETA is mid 2021. 

As [spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) is base on Qt, installing on non `x86_64` systems will thus (currently) **only** yield the `base` and `maxiconda` environments.  

### ‚ÅΩ¬≤‚Åæ Experimental

The installer for `MacOS/M1` is not tested on a **real** '[Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/)/[M1](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/)' yet.
